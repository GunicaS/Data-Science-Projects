## Project Summaries

### Predicting Physician Distribution in the U.S.

This project aims to develop the best multiple linear regression model to predict the number of active physicians in counties across the United States. Using the **CDI2 dataset**, the model analyzes the relationship between physician availability (response variable) and ten explanatory variables covering **demographic, economic, healthcare, and geographic factors**. The goal is to identify the key predictors of physician distribution, which is critical for understanding healthcare disparities and improving resource planning.

### Helicopter Dispatch Frequency Analysis

This project analyzes emergency response patterns by studying helicopter dispatch times from a sheriff's office. Using the **`Helicopter.csv` dataset**, an **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** is performed to examine the frequency of dispatches across different shifts. The analysis, which includes data transformation to meet ANOVA assumptions, aims to provide insights into resource allocation and identify trends in emergency response needs. A significance threshold of 0.05 is used to determine statistical significance.

### Regional Analysis of Education and Income

The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between educational attainment and personal income across different geographic regions of the United States (Northeast, North Central, South, and West). Using the **CDI dataset**, a **Simple Normal Linear Regression Model** is developed for each region to explore how the percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree (predictor variable) influences per capita income (response variable). This analysis seeks to uncover how this relationship varies geographically and determine the role education plays in regional income disparities.

### Hospital Region's Impact on Patient Length of Stay

This project investigates how a hospital's geographic region affects the length of a patient's stay. Using the **`SENIC` dataset**, a **single-factor ANOVA** is conducted to compare the average length of stay across four U.S. regions: North Central (NC), Northeast (NE), West (W), and South (S). The analysis includes assumption diagnostics, outlier handling, and post-hoc analyses such as power tests and pairwise confidence intervals to identify which specific regions differ significantly in patient stay duration.
